# PrototypX
## Overview
PrototypX is a 2D game built using the SFML framework, designed as a personal development playground. This project serves as a practical platform for me to refine my programming skills, focusing on the implementation and testing of various physics algorithms and computational techniques in a game setting. The game is tailored to function on Windows and allows for real-time interaction and experimentation with 2D game mechanics.

## Features
- **2D Game Framework**: Utilizes the SFML library for rendering graphics, managing events, and handling multimedia within a 2D space.
- **Physics and Algorithms**: Dedicated to experimenting with physics simulations and diverse algorithmic challenges.
- **Skill Enhancement**: Created as a means to solidify and expand my coding skills in a fun, interactive way.
- **Customizable Interactions**: Players can tweak game dynamics in real-time to see the impact of different algorithms and simulations.
